## COMP 411: Computer Organization

This repository includes my coursework from COMP 411 at UNC-Chapel Hill taught by Montek Singh

Class topics included: Digital logic, circuit components, data representation, computer architecture, and implementation. The main languages used in this course include C and assembly.

The Mars4_5.jar is not my own. It is an IDE used to write and run our assembly code.

This is just to keep my work organized. Follow the UNC-CH honor code if you choose to look at this for your own coursework.
